My report addresses key questions, including:

Ticket Volume Trends:

• Analyze daily, weekly and monthly volumes

• Compare volumes between workdays and weekends

• Examine ticket distribution during standard work hours versus after hours.

• Recognize peak ticket creation times

Ticket Content and Resolution:

• Identify trends in ticket topics

• Investigate first response and resolution times against SLAs.

• Compare support channels (chat, phone, email)

• Analyze ticket geography for trends in submissions or product issues.

Performance Metrics:
• Evaluate agent SLA adherence for first responses and resolutions.

• Explore customer satisfaction rates across agents, topics and other categories

• Check how quickly tickets move through the resolution process.

Recommendation:
Based on the insights derived from the analysis, here are the top recommendations for improving service level and overall rating:

1. Enhance Product Setup Support:
Insight: 27% of tickets (630) are about product setup, but it has the lowest satisfaction rating (3.4).

Recommendation: Develop comprehensive documentation, including user guides and FAQs. Create step-by-step video tutorials on YouTube for common setup tasks.

2. Improve Email Response Times:
Insight: Over 50% of tickets come through email, but it has the slowest first response time compared to chat and phone.

Recommendation: Implement a target response time of 5 minutes for emails to improve customer experience. Focus on reducing overall resolution times for email inquiries.

3. Leverage Chatbots and AI:
Insight: Only 86.7% of tickets receive a first response within SLA, impacting satisfaction.

Recommendation: Utilize chatbots and AI-powered tools to handle routine inquiries, improving response rates and meeting SLA targets. This frees up human agents for more complex issues.

4. Targeted Agent Training:
Insight: Analyze performance metrics to identify lower-performing agents like(Kristos Westoll).

Recommendation: Provide targeted training programs to address skill gaps and improve the performance of lower-scoring agents.

5. Leverage Top Performers:
Insight: Identify top-performing agents based on metrics like resolution time and ratings.

Recommendation: Assign more complex tickets to top performers to enhance overall efficiency and customer satisfaction.

6. Prioritize High-Priority Tickets:
Insight: Low priority tickets have the Lowest customer satisfaction rating (3.44).

Recommendation: Implement a system to prioritize high-priority tickets to ensure they receive prompt attention and resolution.

7. Focus on Phone Support Satisfaction:
Insight: Phone support has the lowest customer satisfaction rating (3.42) compared to chat (3.54) and email (3.51).

Recommendation: Investigate reasons behind lower phone satisfaction. Consider agent training on phone communication skills and empathy.

8. Address Country-Specific Issues:
Insight: Poland has the highest rating (3.64), while Australia has the lowest (3.24).

Recommendation: Analyze reasons behind lower ratings in specific countries. Consider cultural differences or language barriers, and tailor support strategies accordingly.

9. Enhance SLA Compliance:
Insight: Only 64.4% of tickets are resolved within SLA.

Recommendation: Implement stricter performance tracking and accountability measures for agents to ensure SLA adherence. Consider incentives or rewards for consistent SLA compliance.

10. Optimize Chat Support for After-Hours:
Insight: 67.21% of tickets are created after work hours.

Recommendation: Expand chat support availability during after-hours and weekends to address the surge in ticket volume. Consider implementing live chat features or virtual assistants.
