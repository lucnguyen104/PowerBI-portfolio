My report addresses key questions, including:

Daily changes in ticket status.

Peak times for ticket creation, considering work hours and non-work hours, as well as weekdays and weekends.

Ticket log to provide an overview of tickets.

SLA targets for both first response and resolution, and SLA violations.

The country from which most tickets are created and the trending ticket topic.

Agent performance in terms of average resolution time and SLA violations, as well as ratings received by agents across all levels 1 to 5.
